### Deep Learning Approach to summarize news.

**Solution Strategy:**

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Tokenization using the BERT tokenizer to prepare text for the models.
2. **LSTM Model:**
   * **Architecture:** Self-attention layer, bidirectional LSTM layers, residual connections.
   * **Training:** Dropout, batch normalization, hyperparameter tuning.
   * **Evaluation:** ROUGE scores.
3. **Transformer Model:**
   * **Architecture:** Multi-head attention, position-wise feedforward layers.
   * **Custom Loss:** Combines cross-entropy loss with ROUGE scores.
   * **Training:** Experimenting with learning rates and optimization algorithms.
4. **Pre-Trained Models:**
   * **Selection:** BART, Pegasus, T5.
   * **Fine-tuning:** Using ROUGE scores for evaluation and adaptation.
   * **Evaluation and Comparison:** Assessing performance against LSTM and Transformer models.

**Key Innovations:**

1. **LSTM Model:**
   * **BERT Tokenizer:** Captures contextual nuances in news articles.
   * **Self-Attention Layer:** Dynamically weighs the importance of words and sentences.
   * **Bidirectional LSTM:** Understands context from both past and future.
   * **Residual Connections:** Improves training and information flow.

2. **Transformer Model:**
   * **Multi-Head Attention:** Focuses on different parts of the input simultaneously.
   * **Position-Wise Feedforward Layers:** Captures complex patterns.
   * **Custom Loss Function:** Encourages accurate and fluent summaries.

3. **Pre-Trained Models:**
   * **Leveraging State-of-the-Art:** Using models already effective for summarization.
   * **Fine-tuning:** Adapting pre-trained models to the specific task of summarizing BBC news.

**Additional Notes:**

* The Positional Encoding class in the Transformer model helps the model understand the order of words in the input.
* The use of pre-trained models like BART, Pegasus, and T5 can save time and resources compared to training models from scratch.
